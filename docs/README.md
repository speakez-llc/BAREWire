## Document Structure

The documentation is organized in a sequential manner, beginning with a high-level overview and progressively diving into more specific components of the system:

- **Architecture Overview**: Provides a high-level understanding of the BAREWire system and its components
- **Core Types and Measures**: Details the fundamental data types and measurement units used throughout the system
- **Encoding and Decoding Engine**: Explains the mechanisms for transforming data between different representations
- **Schema System**: Describes how data structures are defined and validated
- **Memory Mapping**: Covers efficient memory management techniques implemented in BAREWire
- **Network Protocol**: Details the communication protocols for networked applications
- **IPC Integration**: Explains how BAREWire integrates with inter-process communication mechanisms

## Getting Started

If you're new to BAREWire, we recommend starting with the [Architecture Overview](./00%20Architecture%20Overview.md) and proceeding through the documents in numerical order for the most coherent learning experience.
